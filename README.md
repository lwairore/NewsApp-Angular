# NewsApp
This application is built using two of the most powerful and popular resources, [Angular 8]() and [material design]().

To bring live news articles the application uses HTTP requests to fetch news articles from [News API](https://newsapi.org/).

By consuming the [News API](https://newsapi.org/), the application is able to get the latest live news articles from a range of [*sources*](https://newsapi.org/sources), including BBC News, CNN, TechCrunch, Huffington Post and more, along with different categories, like technology, sports, business, science and entertainment.
